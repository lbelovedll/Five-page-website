		  <p>  As a child I always wanted to have a major accident or a dramatic moment in life, because I wondered how those people felt while laying on hospital beds receiving attention, sympathy, care, and rest. I would wish for things like cars hitting my bicycle or breaking my ribs or even an arm; it was not the attention I craved but I just wanted to understand what those people who are admitted to the hospital felt. Until it happened.</p>
		 <hr />
		<p> On my tenth birthday, I was excited because my childhood friend Alex had gotten me a gift, do not get me wrong, he gets me one every year, but I had not seen him for three months now, and they were finally coming back on my birthday. We have this yearly tradition, where the other person dresses up the favorite character of whoever’s birthday it was. The fun part was that you had to figure out what character it was yourself, and since Alex had been away for three months it built up my excitement even more. I wondered if he was going to dress up as Thor Toothless or Meliodas. When I got home from school, I refused to go inside, insisting that I wanted to be the one to welcome Alex in. A few minutes later, my mom picked up her ringing phone, and the moment she mentioned Alex’s mom, I ran down the street with a big smile, just one more turn and I would see their grey car coming, but due to excitement, I missed the swerving car coming from the other direction. I hardly remember what happened at that moment, all I remember was the excitement before, the sudden impact, the muffled yelling that I heard minutes or maybe even seconds later, and of course the pain that almost felt like numbness. </p>
         <p>  I woke up the next day and I felt like I was dying. It hurt everywhere more specifically my ribs, but I could not care less it hurt to breathe!! How could it hurt to breathe? My ribs were fractured and I had a broken ankle. This was not what I expected when we visited people in the hospital; they had smiles on their faces, felt better soon, and went home. I felt pain, my movements were restricted. I swallowed pills every time, and although I hated pills, it was either taking them or crying from pain. </p>

           <p> <time datetime="2025-01-23T14:29">January 23,2025,2:29 PM</time>
                  </p>

		  <p>I felt my world stop for the multiple weeks of painkillers, restricted movements, and checkups. I hated it. The visitors came and I could not understand why and how the patients were able to smile at their visitors.
  The day I woke up, Mom called in the doctor, and I tried to focus, on the questions they asked, the light flashed in my eyes, anything, but the stabbing pain in my chest every time I tried to breathe was all I could focus on. I heard my mom speak;
“Beloved h-how do you feel” Mom asked with red puffy eyes 
I responded with two nods, finally looking around my hospital bed I noticed the Thor hammer and the helmet. ‘He picked Thor ‘I thought to myself.
“Everyone was here a while ago; they went to get food with Alex’s mom,” Mom said noticing my wandering eyes. She adjusted my bed and wiped my forehead with a wet towel. We heard the door slide open and there they were. my siblings whose faces I saw every day, Alex in his Thor costume and his mom walking in.  </p>
		 
		<p>“Beloved is awake!! Does it hurt??” Jewel my elder sister asked as she walked up to my bed.“of course, it hurts Jewel she is all wrapped up like a mummy” Alex replied with a quivering voice
“Alex stops crying, she is going to be fine,” Alex’s mom said trying to comfort Alex who had his head hung low, sniffles were heard as he tried to stop his tears.
The worry on their faces was as clear as day, and the pity their eyes held as they looked at me was beginning to feel overwhelming, I looked away telling them I wanted to take a nap, and they could come back later. After a series of sighs, shuffling, and pats on my shoulder, I heard the door open and close, I turned around expecting an empty hospital room, but Alex was there with red eyes, and quivering lips looking at me. I knew I had to speak or he would keep crying.
   “A-alex stop crying, I am alive, aren’t I??” I spoke.
 “Love, I t-thought I was not going to see you agai-n, I thought my best friend was dead, “he said between his sobs, and seeing him cry I could not help but cry as well.
 I do not remember who comforted who but, after a while the tears stopped, the pills kicked in and I finally succumbed to slumber. The next time I woke up everyone was back, and the mood in the air was less heavy. I knew it was going to be like this for a while, and I hated the sudden shift but could do nothing about it.</p>
         <p>Those weeks in 2017 were supposed to be my happiest, but they took a dramatic turn due to me seeing the glass as half empty. 
 I should be happy right? I got what I wanted, a major car accident and the broken ribs and ankles, I was not happy. It was in those painful, terribly slow moments, as I saw my family’s faces, Alex crying and my state did I realized that no one ever wants to be in the state I was in, no matter the face they put on or the emotions they show. </p>

		  <p>As I read “Grief Suite: Inciting Joy “I realized how well you get your message across using poems like “Prayer” by Marie Howe or “To the Young Who Want to Die” by Gwendolyn Brook, as well as the nostalgic writing used to create an atmosphere of empathy, between your feelings and readers’; your usage of universal themes tells us who your audience is; your essay is for anyone who wants to know more about your journey or anyone who has been through the same things.</p>
		 <hr />
		<p>
                 There was one quote that has been stuck in my mind ever since the first reading of this essay. It opens your journey of grief to us, and it says “Grief is a metabolism of change. Perhaps it is for this reason that the bodies of the grieving so often transform in the process of grieving.......everything is connected” (218). I agree with this because when my uncle died, I missed him at family gatherings, his random Instagram post with every one tagged, the hugs I got, and the stories he told us in front of the fireplace when we visited him. The change was clear, and people say it gets better eventually if you go through it and accept what happened, but it slowly got worse when I realized that I would never see him again and that the plans we made were always going to be unfinished.</p>
         <p>     Everyone experiences a form of grief at one point, but no one ever really gets used to it, so the ache we feel when grieving always feels new and worse. That is how I see grief and I believe you see it in a similar light because you said “it seems to me that grief is not gotten over, it is gotten into. And the griever teaches us, reminds us, there is no pulling together, there are only degrees or experience of falling apart” (219). Grief is an overwhelming emotion, and throughout history, grief has been depicted as a process of mourning, with the belief that time will eventually heal all wounds. However, the reality is far more intricate. Grief is not a linear path with a definite end; rather, it is a maze with twists and turns, highs and lows, as we navigate the ever-changing landscape of loss.</p>

                 <p> <time datetime="2025-01-23T14:42">January 23,2025,2:42 PM</time>
                  </p>

		  <p> You spoke of grief as an important part of grace and acceptance and vice versa. You said it was important and necessary for us as human beings, but you also show us through your essay, how you ignored grief, in that paragraph when your friend Lance called after your father’s passing to pay his condolences and you said “...... oh we’re good, we’re good.......but he kindly did not pry, aside from the gentlest you sure? That's ever been spoken....” (216), I believe that what you were trying to show here is that although we need to grief, not everyone wants to or even knows how to grief. Then you asked a question that I found odd to answer for a while, the question was “But what would happen if we truly grieved?” (221); When we allow ourselves to grief, we give ourselves permission to feel the full range of emotions that come with loss. Instead of suppressing our feelings or putting on a brave face, we embrace our pain and allow ourselves to mourn. In doing so, we honor the depths of our love and the magnitude of our loss. </p>
		 <hr />
		<p>In one paragraph you finally begin to speak of grief with a lighter tone, you said” .... because the grieving means we are falling apart, we are changing, and changing in the presence of others we love and are loved by... (223)”. We do not only feel grief for ourselves but also for those we have lost or what we lost and in the presence of loved ones, we find support, drawing strength from the shared understanding of our collective sorrow. Grief is often seen as the “final act of love”, as it reflects the depth of our emotional attachment to someone or something we have lost.</p>
		
         <p>  As a person who communicates with the world through writing, I must say that your willingness to share stories about your past on such subjects that are quite hard to speak of is vulnerable, and it is an act of courage to revisit your past risking judgement from others. However, I believe that by doing so you give voices to those who might be going through the exact same experiences. I see your essay as you simply telling them that they are not alone in any journey in life.   Thank you for taking the time to read Final Act of Love, a response to “Grief Suite: Inciting Joy”.</p>
