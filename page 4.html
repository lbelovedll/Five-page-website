		  <p>In a world where ignorance breeds stigma, the shadow of misconception looms large over those grappling with mental diagnosis. Mental illness adds layers of complexity to the human story, while stigma weaves a tangled web of ignorance and barriers for those affected. You would assume that with many people talking about mental illness people would have fewer misconceptions, and be more educated about mental illness. However, these misconceptions are still present in our society, in the world at large, but people see these misconceptions as the truth and treat them as common knowledge about mental illness. This brings up my question: What are the common stigmas mental health diagnosis face and how can we combat those stigmas? </p>
		 <hr />
		<p>Let us talk about why these stereotyped misconceptions about mental  Illness diagnosis is still the general knowledge people have about mental illness. In an article by the Journal of Mental Health titled “DSM-V and the Stigma of Mental Illness, the authors Ben-Zeev, Dror, et al, spoke about the types of stigmas surrounding mental illness and, the relationship between groupness and stereotypes.  </p>
         <p>
		 </p> The connection between group messaging and stereotypes works both ways. Stereotypes are meaningful within a specific social group but are often forgotten for broader categories. Therefore, interventions that enhance group cohesion will reinforce stereotypes linked to mental illness. Stereotypes serve as negative descriptors for mental diagnoses (4)</p>
</article>

          <h2>Grouping-Stereotypes</h2>
           <p> <time datetime="2025-01-23T14:29">January 23,2025,2:29 PM</time>
                  </p>
  

<p>I find the whole groupness and stereotypes quite fascinating but also concerning. The bidirectional relationship between these two concepts has an incredibly significant implication as to how society perceives and treats those with mental health diagnoses. The notion that stereotypes only make sense when applied to a group of people is frightening. The idea of groupness adds another layer to this problem, by lumping all people with mental illness into one group, irrespective of the different mental illnesses they have, and behavioral differences we unintentionally reinforce the stereotypes associated with them. The vicious cycle makes it difficult to see mental diagnoses beyond their diagnosis. There are also types of stigmas of mental illness. Ben-Zeev, et al said, </p>
		 
		<p>Psychiatric disorders can have devastating impacts on people's lives due to the significant distress and disability they cause. Many advocates and scientists believe that stigmas surrounding mental illness also wreak havoc on the lives of those affected. There are three key ways in which the stigma of mental illness Can impact people’s lives. There is the phenomenon of “Public Stigma”- the negative attitudes, stereotypes, and discriminatory behaviors exhibited by the general public towards those with mental health diagnoses. The next one is “Self Stigma” - the internalization of the negative public attitude by the individual with the diagnosis, and lastly the stigma of mental illness can result in “Label Avoidance”- the tendency of some individuals to avoid disclosing their condition or seeking treatment to avoid being labeled as mentally ill. (Ben-Zeev, Dror, et al. 1). </p>
         <p>The impacts any form of stigma has on patients are deeply troubling. When society views mental illness negatively, this public stigma leads to discrimination in many areas. With self-individual internalizes these societal biases, and with label avoidance, individuals with mental illness diagnosis have a fear of being tagged as "Mentally ill” and it can discourage them from seeking help leading to more profound consequences. It is disheartening to realize that these individuals already struggle with their mental health, but they also must deal with such bias and isolation. I once went with my cousin to visit his wife who was suffering from a mental illness and while we were there, I met this little boy named James. When he met me, he begged me not to be afraid of him, finding that odd, I asked if he ever thought I would fear him. He said his friends at school were afraid of him, that he was mean sometimes and then super nice the other times, which he does not remember, he had split personality disorder. It made me sad and what made it even worse was that the parents had a meeting to sign a petition to move him to a school for the disabled saying he was a threat. James was 8 when all of this happened, I met him when he was 9 and he still thought he was a threat.  </p>

                  </p>

		  <p>Separating mentally diagnosed people from everyone else is something we do unconsciously in this society. This phenomenon extends beyond segregation, as the stigmatized individual and those labeled as “unhealthy others” find themselves ostracized within the same social group that perpetuates their marginalization. In an  article by the Journal of Mental Health titled “A Mental Health Service Users Perspective to Stigmatisation”, the authors Green, Gill, et al, spoke about this very issue;  </p>
		 <hr />
		<p>The stigmatized individual and those seen as "unhealthy others" are within the same social group that rejects their stigma. They internalize societal norms and standards, which, as observed in a study of people with HIV (Green and So bored, 200), leads to self-discrediting. Disapproval towards the stigmatized is not solely from the "normal" members; it can foster self-hatred and shame. Negative cultural attitudes contribute to internalized stigma, shaping the individual's self-concept in a self-fulfilling manner. (6)    </p>
         <p>When we talk about the 'unhealthy others,' we are referring to people who are marginalized because they do not fit into what society deems as normal. These individuals are part of the very society that marginalizes them. They grow up in it, live in it, and are exposed to its norms and expectations. To break this cycle, we need to shift societal attitudes towards acceptance and understanding, replacing judgment and prejudice with empathy and respect. </p>

                 <h2>Stigma's Coverage</h2>
                 <p> <time datetime="2025-01-23T14:42">January 23,2025,2:42 PM</time>
                  </p>

		  <p>I have a sub-question to ask, how widespread is stigma? Well, the question was asked by the authors Green, Gill, et al, and they went on to answer that question by saying “Many studies have shown that socially stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental health problems are widespread (Byrne, 1997, 2001). In a recent survey in  Britain (Crisp et al., 2000), people with a range of seven mental disorders were perceived by the general population as hard to talk to, ‘different’, and unpredictable. People with schizophrenia, alcoholism, and drug addiction were thought by 70% of those surveyed to be dangerous, and substance misusers were thought to be blameworthy for their condition. Differentness, unpredictability, dangerousness, and blame have all been identified as factors that fuel stigma  (Jones et al., 1984).” (12).  </p>
		 <hr />
		<p>The widespread perception of those with mental illness as ‘different', 'unpredictable’, and even ‘dangerous’ irrespective of the difference in every mental issue is indicative of the prejudices within our Society. So, I want to ask this question again, what are the common stigmas mental health diagnoses face and how can we combat those stigmas?  There are three types of stigmas mental health diagnosis face, now we need to discuss how to combat those Stigmas. There are many ways to combat stigmas that mental health diagnoses face let us start with a few </p>
		
         <p>1. Education and Awareness: Promote accurate information about mental health conditions through education campaigns in schools, workplaces, and communities. Increase awareness of the prevalence and impact of mental health issues to reduce misconceptions and foster empathy. People are always learning, and books are the main way we learn so I hope we pick up books about mental illness and health occasionally. There is a book called Mental Illness (opposing viewpoints) by Noah Berlatsky the book is an immense help to anyone who wants to know about mental illness irrespective of the aspect you are looking at or from it has it in there.. </p>
<p>2. Challenging Stereotypes: Encourage open discussions to challenge stereotypes and misconceptions about mental illness. Highlight the diversity of experiences within the mental health community to combat generalizations and promote understanding. 3. Language Matters: Promote the use of respectful and person-first language when discussing mental health. Avoid stigmatizing language that perpetuates negative stereotypes and reinforces discrimination. 4. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policies that protect the rights of individuals with mental health conditions and promote access to equitable treatment and support services. Support legislative efforts to combat discrimination and promote mental health parity.   </p>

                 <p> <time datetime="2025-01-23T14:50">January 23,2025,2:50 PM</time>
                  </p>

		  <p>6. Media Representation: Advocate for accurate and sensitive portrayals of mental health issues in the media. Challenge sensationalized depictions that reinforce stigma and promote realistic and diverse representations of mental health experiences. The media  plays a significant role in shaping the public perception about mental health.  </p>
		 <hr />
		<p>By implementing these strategies collectively, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and supportive society where individuals with mental health diagnoses are accepted, valued, and treated with dignity and respect.</p>
