		  <p>Our genetic makeup influences everything from our physical traits to the possibility of certain diseases. Understanding the principle of inheritance is especially important. Inheritance means the process of transmission of genes from parents to their offspring. Genes determine traits and characteristics. Dominant and Recessive genes play a vital role in determining the characteristics we inherit from our parents, laying a foundation for who we are in profound ways. Dominant genes need only one copy to manifest in an individual’s phenotype, but recessive genes need two copies for expression.  </p>
		 <hr />
		<p> The importance of understanding genetics is especially important in fields like medicine, psychology, and education. In medicine, the study of genetics helps with identifying genetic mutations that could be responsible for diseases like cystic fibrosis. With a good understanding of genetics, we can detect these types of mutations at early non-life-threatening stages, create personalized treatment procedures, they can even offer gene therapy. Personalized treatment plans require personalized drugs, and understanding the relationship between genetics and drug response helps with personalizing these drugs to increase their effects.  </p>
         <p>In psychology understanding genetic influences can help create more effective therapy treatment. Genetics has a hand in developmental disorders like Autism Spectrum and ADHD. There is also the case with addiction, a person with high alcohol tolerance could have a high alcohol metabolism, affecting how quickly alcohol is broken down in the body. With education, they are diverse ways in which the study and understanding of genetics help, people are different from other people and their traits and genes influence these differences, in school, people learn things at different paces, and look different, understanding this and trying to make a better environment for people is something important. Understanding genetics gives us a better understanding of the human body and behavior. </p>

          <h2>Genetic Fundamentals</h2>
           <p> <time datetime="2025-01-23T14:29">January 23,2025,2:29 PM</time>
                  </p>

		  <p>This essay will explore the fundamental principles of dominant and recessive gene inheritance, giving examples of traits that are both common and uncommon, genetic disorders, and treatments. It will also explain the pattern of inheritance through tools like Punnett squares and DNA Sequencing. It will also explain the psychological and societal implications of these genetic traits.  </p>
		 
		<p>Genetic fundamentals are the basic principles that govern how traits are passed on from generation to generation;  

We start with DNA; Deoxyribonucleic Acid is a molecule responsible for carrying genetic information. A DNA structure is created by attaching nucleotides to form two long strands that spiral to create a structure called a double helix. DNA has four nitrogenous atoms that make up its code A[Adenine], T[Thymine], G[Guanine], and C[Cytosine]. Think of DNA as a blueprint for a building. 

Genes are the basic physical and functional units of hereditary, they are a specific section of the DNA that create specific traits. They act like a command or a set of instructions within the DNA molecule, giving commands and dictating the production of proteins. In that blueprint (DNA) the genes are the individual sections within the blueprint, each one dedicated to a specific function. </p>
         <p>Chromosomes are organized structures within a nucleus that contain tightly coiled DNA. Humans are said to have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Chromosomes contain the genetic material of an organism. If DNA is considered the blueprint, then the chromosomes would be considered a folder holding those blueprints in an organized and condensed form. 

 Alleles are variants of a gene that occur at a specific location on a chromosome, the gene that determines the hair color has several alleles, including one for black, brunet, blond, and red hair. It can be categorized as normal/ wild type or abnormal/mutant type. Each allele occupies a specific location on the chromosome called the gene locus.  

Homozygous and Heterozygous: homozygous is when you inherit the same DNA sequence for a specific gene from each of your biological parents while heterozygous is when you inherit different alleles of a gene from each of your parents  </p>
<p>Genotypes and Phenotypes: Genotypes are the genetic makeup of an individual that determines its hereditary potential and limitations. They are determined by the combination of genes inherited from both parents, while phenotypes are observable physical traits, which are created due to the relation between their genetic makeup and environments. 

Principles of inheritance (Mendel’s Law): Gregor Mendel's law of segregation states that two alleles for each trait segregate during the formation of gametes, meaning that the gametes carry only one allele for each gene. The law of independent assortment says that alleles can segregate independently during the formation of gametes. 

Dominant and Recessive Alleles: If an allele needs only one copy to express the phenotype it is dominant, if it requires two copies, then it is recessive. When they are represented in written form the dominant allele with a capital letter (e.g.: B) while the recessive allele is written in a small letter (e.g.: b). 

Mutation: This is a permanent change in the structure of the deoxyribonucleic Acid and can be transmitted to descendants' cell by DNA replication. These changes can be as small as a single base substitution or as big as the deletion of an entire gene section. Anemia, for example, is caused by mutations in the genes that code for hemoglobin. </P>

		  <p>Dominant traits: the allele for brown eyes is dominant over the allele for blue eyes. This means that even if an offspring has both alleles for brown and blue eyes, they will have brown eyes, and the percentage is far higher than the one for them having blue eyes, in an analogous way the allele for curly hair is dominant over the allele for straight hair. A disorder caused by a dominant allele is called Huntington's disease, an offspring only needs to inherit one copy of the faulty gene from one of the parents to develop this disease.  </p>
		 <hr />
		<p>Recessive Traits:  with recessive traits, the offspring must inherit two copies of the recessive alleles of that trait, which means that for them to have blue eyes or straight hair then need to inherit two copies of the recessive alleles for blue eyes or straight hair one from each parent. The same thing occurs when we are talking about a disorder caused by recessive alleles, the offspring needs to inherit two copies of the faulty gene to have these diseases, like Anemia or Cystic Fibrosis. </p>
         <p>There is also a term called “Carriers” it is given to individuals who inherit only one copy of recessive alleles for a genetic disorder. They do not possess the disorder themselves because the dominant alleles cover the effect, however, it can still be passed on to their offspring

                 <h2>Patterns of Inheritance and Genetic Tools  </h2>
                 <p> <time datetime="2025-01-23T14:42">January 23,2025,2:42 PM</time>
                  </p>

		  <p>These tools are in place to help track and predict dominant and or recessive inheritance, hence a pattern of inheritance. There are also a lot of tools to do this but today I will only be diving into Punnett squares and DNA Sequencing... </p>
		 <hr />
		<p>Punnett squares: In this study or rather the way this tool works to help us understand the pattern of inheritance we must imagine each parent contributing an allele to their offspring. A Punnett square acts like a grid showing the possible combinations of these alleles. Using this article, I found where the author Wimsatt W talked about how Punnett squares represent genotypes, explaining it; They said “A square tabular array was introduced by R. C. Punnett in (1907) to visualize systematically and economically the combination of gametes to make genotypes according to Mendel’s theory. This mode of representation evolved and rapidly became standardized as the canonical way of representing problems in genetics. Its advantages over other contemporary methods are discussed, as are ways it evolved to increase its power and efficiency and respond to changing theoretical perspectives. It provided a natural visual decomposition of a complex problem into several interrelated stages. This explains its computational and conceptual power, for one could simply “read off” answers to a wide variety of questions simply from the “right” visual representation of the problem, and represent multiple problems, and multiple layers of problems in the same diagram” (Wimsatt 359). Let us consider the dominant trait of brown eyes and the recessive trait of blue eyes and make a Punnett square myself: </p>
		
         <p>“B” for dominant allele- Brown eyes 

“b” for recessive allele- Blue eyes 

BB: Brown eyes –Homozygous -dominant 

Bb: Brown eyes –Heterozygous 

bb: Blue eyes- Homozygous –recessive 

One parent has brown eyes (Bb-Heterozygous), the other has blue eyes(bb) </p>

                 <h2>DNA Sequencing </h2>
                 <p> <time datetime="2025-01-23T14:50">January 23,2025,2:50 PM</time>
                  </p>

		  <p>this tool allows us to “read” the precise sequence of nucleotides in a person's DNA. In this article by Chaux, Frédéric, et al. They wrote about DNA sequencing and in their results, they said: 

“We extracted genomic DNA following the presented protocol (S1 File) and applied size selection using the Short Read Eliminator (SRE) kit (Circulomics), an easy-to-use method that does not require dedicated devices which is based on a length-dependent precipitation of nucleic acids driven by polyvinylpyrrolidone crowding. Substantial amounts of small DNA fragments can be detrimental for long-read Nanopore sequencing [18], not only because the subsequent reads are short, but also because these molecules can outcompete the longer ones, both for adapter ligation and pore usage, thus yielding suboptimal results. The size distribution of the extracted DNA was assessed by PFGE and Nanopore sequencing, with and without size-selection for HMW DNA. Samples were migrated in a pulse field, stained by ethidium bromide, and imaged with UV light (Fig 1A). The DNA molecules extracted without size selection migrated as a large smear spread between approximately 1.5 and 150 kb. After size selection with the SRE kit, the upper part of the distribution remained unchanged while the low-molecular-weight fragments (< 10 kb) were visibly reduced. We made a similar observation after electrophoresis and staining of the samples in a 0.3% agarose gel” (Chaux, Frédéric, et al. 2). Here they are talking about how helpful DNA Sequencing has been extremely helpful with their research. 

  </p>
		 <hr />
		<p>People do not talk about the impact genetics has on individuals, families, and society. Carrying a recessive gene like sickle cell anemia can affect the individual and their family mentally, physically, and financially, there is this constant need to worry about them, the slightest injuries are fatal so every day would be quite draining for them. During pregnancy, the parents would be in a state of constant worry as well because they cannot tell if the recessive gene would manifest itself in their offspring or not, they do not know until the baby is born. There is also the aspect of physical appearance affecting social interactions, there is also bullying and racism, stigmas could arise around these gender disorders as well. Our cultural and Historical aspect also has its own impacts, society has certain standards, when we fall below them, we are looked up through judgmental lenses, albinism for example, it is considered a recessive genetic disorder that affects the production of melanin. In some African countries people with albinism face severe discrimination. </p>
		 
         <p>Hopefully, the importance of understanding genetic makeup is understood after reading this essay, the importance of genetics when dealing with medicine, education, and psychology. The dominant and recessive genes have an impact on a lot of things, people get bullied for the way they look or their skin color when there is nothing to be done about it since it is genetics. There is a certain standard to be met and not everyone does, so they face discrimination often, even as their word continues to grow and become more aware. The tools mentioned in this essay are of great importance but are not the only genetic tool we have for pattern of inheritance. Hopefully as time goes on people will have a better understanding of genetics and its relation and connection with other subjects
