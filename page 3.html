		  <p>Among the various schools of psychology Gestalt school stands out as my favorite school. The whole idea of looking at the big picture / getting the full story is something I have always agreed with. I believe that everything that happens to someone happens due to a reaction to their earlier experience or actions and if we just try to fix the problem without understanding the cause or beginning, are we really fixing it or simply giving it a temporary solution? We understand that a person with trauma had a terrible experience once or multiple times even, and with gestalt therapy we try to understand how past experiences are affecting the person in this present moment. </p>
		 <hr />
		<p>As I grew up there has always been one thing I wanted the most and that was that my mom or anyone would let me say my side of the story but she never let me, it has always been the case of whoever speaks first is saying the true story, and that was and still is the worst thing you could do to me. One time in high school I had been talking to my senior online, in 2021 and I was 14, he was my best friend's elder brother, we were close I even called him dad as a joke sometimes and our chats had this whole friendly appeal, and since I edit he asked me to make him one, that I could choose the song and all so I did. It was a trending song at the time, something along the lines of my heart is for you, it beats for you... A few days later my cousin asked to use my phone and from that point onward it was a whole mess. My cousin called the boy, asked him to leave me alone, called my mom, and then the principal told her we were close, she saw us together, and I was the one trying to ask him out and kept disturbing him. My mom would not let me speak. I was grounded and everything because of that, and I pleaded with her to tell her what happened, but I never got a chance. I suppose that is the reason I listen to people’s full stories before making decisions or giving advice because it is not something that I had the privilege to get used to, and that is the main reason I chose Gestalt therapy as my top school of psychology. 
 </p>
         <p> While I was trying to understand gestalt therapy better, I came across this case study where the authors Flores, Kim, et al wrote about how drumming sessions held for children between the ages of seven and twelve who had difficulty connecting led to noticeable improvements like more positive moods and emotional expressions after these sessions. It suggests a reduction in the negative emotions. They seemed to also have better self-control and did better at social gatherings. They were able to release pent-up energy that could be associated with negative emotions (Flores, Kim, et al, 3, Sept 2016). At first, I was quite confused, because this seemed like it was drawing away from both the big picture and small parts, but I thought about it again and I realized that instead of searching for the cause or beginning of the child’s withdrawals the drumming sessions were an opportunity to for the child to connect and for them to monitor him for any signs of withdrawal and what caused it in that very moment. The “cause” mattered less than the child's current pattern. </p>

		  <p>The two videos I watched were about two technologies that help the brain; electroconvulsive therapy and deep brain stimulation. Electroconvulsive therapy has some strong points, it is a non-surgical procedure and less expensive than DBS. This procedure also provides quicker relief and is fast acting however because multiple treatments are usually required it can lead to memory issues, there are also other side effects like mild headaches, confusion, or even muscle pain after this procedure. Since this procedure has been going on for over 80 years it is important to weigh the benefits and potential risks. It is also important because it can be made use of during urgent situations. Deep Brain Simulation on the other hand takes a surgical approach where a pacemaker-like device is placed in the chest or upper abdomen while they implant electrodes precisely where they can best influence brain activity, and together they effectively regulate brain activity. The DBS drew me in more because it is a better option for precision and long duration, and it has fewer cognitive side effects, I also learned that it is considered more when ECT or other techniques fail. </p>
		 
		<p>My aunt Grace suffered from bipolar disorder at an incredibly early age and had gone for therapy all her life and was always on treatment, her episodes grew more frequent and were followed by depression that always left her distant and hollow, the fluctuation in her moods continued to disrupt her life in every little way. She would suddenly have unusually highly euphoric moods, and in the next minute she was angry or sad, she was also very impulsive and had thoughts that threatened her life. Her mood swings were extreme and uncontrollable. Her therapist recommended her to a specialist who suggested both procedures to her while listing the benefits and side effects of both. In the end, they ended up choosing deep brain stimulation and she has had this machine with her ever since and her mood swings have been far better ever since. </p>
         <p>While trying to find recent technologies that are available for helping the brain, I found an article titled Treatment of Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (TDCS): Study Protocol for a Parallel, Randomized, Double-Blinded, Sham-Controlled, Multicenter Trial (Stim-ADHD) and in this article the authors Mauche, Nicole, et al were trying to evaluate the effectiveness of tDCS as a treatment for ADHD and to determine wether it can improve ADHD symptoms in adults. This study aims to determine whether tDCS can significantly reduce ADHD- Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disease marked by inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. It affects 2.8% of the world population and can last till adulthood in 60% of childhood cases. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may be an alternate or additional treatment for ADHD, improving cognitive and clinical symptoms (Mauche, Nicole, et al, 1, Feb 2024).  </p>

		  <p>Classical Conditioning: about nine years ago, my family was going through a very rough time, which would probably be dated back to when my mom decided to marry my dad, we had a lot of issues and he would become aggressive and everything in his path was crushed or shoved or pounced on, basically any form of violence he could think of, my mom, my three siblings and I were all in that path. During that time my mom would lock us up in the room the moment she noticed him getting home, and during that moment my elder sister would pull out my mom's phone connect the earplugs to them and hand them over to me, I generally played the song to block the noise at first, but over time, hearing that song during or even outside the times he came home just made me even more anxious.   </p>
		 <hr />
		<p>The 6-stage process of classical conditioning: Neutral Stimulus: The song used to hold no meaning to me before this. Acquisition: Before acquisition, the song was just a song and my dad’s behavior triggered my fear, they existed separately in my mind.  After I began listening to the song every time we anticipated him walking through the door and hitting whoever opened it. My brain began to connect them. Then the moment I heard that song play anywhere no matter the time I began to tremble and sob quietly. Unconditioned Stimulus: My dad’s aggressive behavior, whenever he arrives. Unconditioned Response: The feeling of fear when someone is in a threatening situation. Conditioned Stimulus: The song (Which now has a response because it has been associated with my dad’s behavior). Conditioned Response: I feel anxiety when I hear that song, whether or not my dad was home. Extinction:  I never had extinction occur, but for it to occur I would need to listen to the same song repeatedly, and when my brain notices that my father is not coming home or anywhere near me even tho that same song is playing the response would gradually reduce. 
Operant Conditioning: I started learning Italian a while back on Duolingo, and I have kept at it for 45 days consecutively because I received a streak badge.  Because I have an achievement drive it encourages me every time, I see my streak go up.  </p>
         <p>einforcement Schedule: The daily streak badge is a fixed interval, I receive this positive reinforcement after every lesson of the day has been completed. This makes me open the app everyday so I can maintain my streak. Modeling:  I have always had stage fright, so public speaking has never been for me. When I got to eighth grade, I got selected as the school representative and had to give a speech. I really could not do it and went to meet my elder sister to complain to her, but my sister was the student president of the school and was already holding her speech, I witnessed my sister confidently speaking in front of others. As I observed her, I admired her confidence and wanted to make sure I was like her on that stand. I went home and started practicing, mimicking her every move and gesture, even how she spoke, the parts she coughed or stopped to, just changing her words to the one for my speech. There was one time I read about counterconditioning, from what I read I understood that it was a behavioral technique used to replace an unwanted response with a wanted response. It is used often in therapy procedures. In an article by Grings, William W., and Tadao Uno, they talked about how counterconditioning is used for helping people with fears and phobias, in one paragraph they said “Counterconditioning of autonomic responses was evaluated using a compound stimulus transfer paradigm. During three sessions on different days, Ss were conditioned to give a GSR to a visual stimulus (colored light) and further trained to relax on the presentation of a visually projected stimulus word. After training on both experiences had progressed, test trials were introduced to assess the magnitude of response to the fear cue alone and the compound stimulus created by the simultaneous presentation of both cues (the word superimposed on the colored light background). Significant inhibitory transfer effects were observed with the GSR. On the last test trials the digital pulse volume showed less constriction to the compound of fear and relaxation stimuli than to the fear stimulus alone “(Grings, William W., and Tadao Uno, 479). </p>

		  <p>The decision to attend North Hennepin College was influenced by external sources displaying extrinsic motivation. I had a situational motivation process for picking this college because my age and the environmental support made it a good fit for transition into further education. I was also motivated by intrinsic motivation driven by an achievement drive. My achievement drive is the main reason I decided to go to college to begin. </p>

                 <p> I wanted to go to a university the moment I graduated high school to continue achieving things because I thrived on that drive and school was my whole life and still is, I know nothing outside of school,but at the time I was 15 years old, and my mom would not want me moving to a state that was 24 hours away. While searching for one I could go to for two years I found North Hennepin and applied, because it was closer to the house, and compared to a traditional university, this college had more personalized support and resources for 16-year-old me.  </p>
		 <hr />
		<p>To understand the topic motivation I did some research and found an article by Sansone, Carol, and Yun Tang and in this article they talked about how certain things influence motivation and two types of motivation, in this article the said: “The target article by Ryan et al. (2021) does a masterful job of reviewing the contributions and impact of Self-Determination Theory (SDT). We highlight the tremendous influence that SDT, and particularly Cognitive-Evaluation Theory (CET), has had in shaping the notions of “intrinsic” and “extrinsic” motivation. Initial work on the over justification effect (e.g., Lepper et al., 1973) suggested that a reward decreased motivation to engage with a previously intrinsically motivated activity when it caused people to attribute their motivation to the reward. CET went further to shift the focus from locus of the cause to what the reward means in terms of competence and autonomy. CET proposed that when rewards are contingent on achieving some performance standard, the effect of receiving the reward depends on whether indicators of competence (which would enhance intrinsic motivation) or attempts to control (which would detract from intrinsic motivation) were more salient. CET thus helped emphasize that the effects of reward on motivation cannot be predicted without considering how reward structures influenced these underlying processes “(Sansone, Carol, and Yun Tang,113). </p>

		  <p>My animal from the personality test was the golden retriever, and I believe that your description of me was quite accurate with my actual personality. The only part that did not seem right was that you made mention of golden retrievers following the lions around, but for me, my friends are mostly if not all otters. Which was also my second-highest column. I believe that the reason this test works is that the words in each column represent traits that people can recognize quickly the columns are things people would use to describe themselves on a normal day and this test simply arranged them into columns and at the end the one with the highest amount was where your personality strongly showed or represented your personality the most.  </p>
		 <hr />
		<p>I had an extra piece of the Kilbournian Personality Test, and I had my family members take the test and described them according to their results; however, they said it was because I knew them well, so I re-did it with a group of people I did not know ( My friend’s relatives were visiting for the first time) and they all agreed with the results and description I have the, although the fifth grader who fell into the otter column said he thought lion was a cooler animal and wanted a change of animals. 
The personality test is more than just a way to kill time, like those “Which the beatless member are you? “That we find while scrolling online, and while trying to find out more I found an article “PERSONAILTY” by Schley Lacy and they talked about the big five questionnaires, and they made mention of this one called “Role Construct Repertory.” They said; </p>
		 
         <p>George Kelly, founder of the personal construct/cognitive theory, developed this tool, commonly referred to as the Rep test. There are two steps. In the first, you list 20 to 30 people who fulfill specific roles in your life, such as mother or friend. The second part is the crux of the test. The proctor picks three people from the list and asks you to describe how two of them are similar to each other and different from the third person. Each trio is supposed to reveal a construct you' ve built and thus, according to Kelly's theory, how you think about the world. Thanks to its open-ended nature, the Rep test reveals twice as much information as the Big Five questionnaire. </p>
